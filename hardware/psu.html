            <h2>What is a PSU?</h2>
            <p>The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is a critical component in any computer system. It converts the AC (Alternating Current) from your wall outlet into DC (Direct Current) that the computer components can safely use. A PSU also regulates the voltage to ensure stable and safe power delivery to all connected hardware.</p>

            <h2>Types of PSUs</h2>
            <p>There are several types of PSUs, including ATX, SFX, and modular variants. Modular PSUs allow you to connect only the cables you need, improving cable management and airflow. Non-modular PSUs have all cables fixed, which can make the inside of your PC look messier but are generally cheaper.</p>

            <h2>Power Ratings</h2>
            <p>PSUs are rated in watts (W), which indicates how much power they can supply. Choosing the correct wattage depends on the total power consumption of your components. For example, a gaming PC with a high-end GPU may need 650W or more, while a basic office PC might function with 300-400W.</p>

            <h2>Efficiency and Certifications</h2>
            <p>Efficiency measures how much power from the wall actually reaches the components versus how much is lost as heat. Look for certifications like 80 Plus Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. Higher-rated PSUs waste less energy and generate less heat, which improves system longevity.</p>

            <h2>Usage and Importance</h2>
            <p>A high-quality PSU ensures that your components receive stable power, preventing crashes, random reboots, or damage from power surges. It is especially important for systems with powerful GPUs or CPUs, as underpowered PSUs can lead to instability and component failure.</p>

            <h2>Installation Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the PSU fits in your case form factor (ATX, SFX, etc.).</li>
                <li>Connect only the cables required for your components.</li>
                <li>Check the orientation of the fan and airflow direction.</li>
                <li>Secure the PSU firmly to prevent vibrations or movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is a Motherboard?</h2>
            <p>The motherboard, also known as the mainboard or system board, is the central printed circuit board (PCB) of a computer. It connects and allows communication between critical components like the CPU, RAM, storage drives, GPU, and peripheral devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Components:</strong> Chipset, CPU socket, RAM slots, PCIe slots, SATA connectors, M.2 slots, USB ports, audio jacks, and power connectors.</p>

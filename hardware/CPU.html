            <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
            <p>The CPU is often called the brain of the computer. It executes instructions, performs calculations, and manages data processing for programs and the operating system. Modern CPUs may have multiple cores and threads, improving multitasking and performance in demanding applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The CPU is critical for overall system speed. Faster CPUs with more cores provide better performance for gaming, programming, video editing, and professional tasks.</p>

            <h2>CPU Architecture</h2>
            <p>CPU architecture determines how efficiently the processor handles instructions. Factors include the number of cores, clock speed, cache memory, and support for technologies like Hyper-Threading or simultaneous multithreading (SMT).</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the CPU is compatible with your motherboard socket and chipset.</p>

            <h2>Coolers</h2>
            <p>CPU coolers prevent overheating and maintain stable performance. There are two main types: air coolers (with heatsinks and fans) and liquid coolers (AIO or custom loops). Choosing an appropriate cooler depends on CPU TDP (thermal design power) and case airflow.</p>

            <h2>Installation & Maintenance</h2>
            <p>When installing a CPU cooler, always apply thermal paste between the CPU and cooler base for efficient heat transfer. Secure the cooler properly according to manufacturer instructions. Clean the cooler and remove dust periodically to maintain cooling efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
            <p>High-performance CPUs and overclocking setups may require advanced cooling solutions. Liquid cooling systems provide lower temperatures but need careful maintenance. Always monitor CPU temperatures using software tools to prevent thermal throttling.</p>
